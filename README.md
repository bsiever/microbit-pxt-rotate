# Misc. 

I develop micro:bit extensions in my spare time to support activities I'm enthusiastic about, like summer camps and science curricula.  You are welcome to become a sponsor of my micro:bit work (one time or recurring payments), which helps offset equipment costs: [here](https://github.com/sponsors/bsiever). Any support at all is greatly appreciated!
